## Module 3 Challenge, 6 July 2023, Python Challenge

Development on this project has stopped

## Description

Two different functions, PyBank and PyPoll.

PyBank analyzes a .csv of financial data and returns the total number of months available, total profits, average monthly change, and greatest monthly % increase and decrease (with month).

PyPoll analyzes a .csv of voting data and returns the total number of votes, the winnner, and a list of each candidate's name, % of votes won, and number of votes won.

Both PyBank and PyPoll print out the results to the terminal, and write those same results to a basic .txt file.

## Usage

Run each program from the command line or an IDE like VS Code. Terminal output should look like this:

PyBank:
